Hey everyone, I am Karan. This is ForgeAI, my hackathon project that turns a plain language study request into the right learning UI automatically.

ForgeAI does not show one generic chat panel. It chooses between multiple StudyForge components like lessons, quizzes, flashcards, comparisons, explainers, and study plans so the experience feels like a real learning app.

The stack is Next.js App Router, React 18, Tailwind CSS, and Tambo. The architecture is simple:
- UI components live in src/components/studyforge
- Tambo registers them in src/lib/tambo.ts
- The chat thread renders the selected component next to the assistant message

Now I will show the product. On the landing page, you can see the component gallery. I open the chat and type: Explain the French Revolution and quiz me. ForgeAI selects the explainer card and the quiz card automatically. The UI is clean and flat so it stays readable and professional.

If I ask for flashcards or a study plan, it switches to those components without me choosing anything. This is the point: the system picks the right UI for the request.

There is also a How it works page that explains the pipeline and the hackathon build. Tambo handles routing and schema driven props so every component stays consistent.

This project helped me learn how to structure AI outputs into reusable UI instead of raw text. Thanks for watching.
